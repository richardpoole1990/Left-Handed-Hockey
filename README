After being raised by a Left Handed athelete, I always heard left handed players are more versatile. With some of the better known atheletes, such as Babe Ruth, Larry Bird, and Oscar De La Hoya, it would be hard to debate the fact that left handed players can compete at the top level. My question would be, is there a difference in the numbers between left handed and right handed players?

I chose NHL because, Left Hand Dominance shows in 10% of the population, the NHL currently has larger left handed population than the right handed.
